# Alzheimer's Care Web

Welcome to the Alzheimer's Care Web, a comprehensive AI-based system designed to assist in the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This project integrates advanced technologies to provide early detection, risk prediction, emotion recognition, and cognitive enhancement for patients.

## Features

**MRI Analysis for Early Detection and Staging**  
Utilizes the EfficientNetV2B0 architecture with 92.5% accuracy to assess structural brain changes.

**Emotion Recognition & Response System**  
Employs deep CNNs (ResNet50, VGG16) and SVM/Random Forest for facial and vocal emotion analysis.

**Alzheimer's Risk Prediction System**  
Uses the Random Forest algorithm with 96.3% accuracy to predict risk based on 32 attributes across 2,149 records.

**Memory Therapy and Cognitive Enhancement**  
Offers game-based exercises and voice-based storytelling with performance tracking.
